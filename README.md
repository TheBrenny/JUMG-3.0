### What is JUMG?
JUMG (pronounced 'Jum-Gee', acronymed 'Java Utilities for Making Games') is a library that contains multiple utilities to make Java Games the most efficient way. JUMG utilises the concepts of separating certain portions of code from the rest, to allow one main class to bring them altogether.

As JUMG is in development, it is necessary for a checklist to be made of what needs to be added, and what is added. This is here for simplicity's sake:
<br>
**JUMG Development Checklist:**

_Currently I'm working on my project for Uni while I continue to work on JUMG. This is because my project depends on JUMG. As I work through, changes will occur and enhancements will be made, thus making the changes on this list seem eratic. Just bear with me._ :ok_hand: 

#### Demo
Check out the demo game which is a project for my Computer Games course at Uni, [BattleCell](https://github.com/TheBrenny/BattleCell)!

#### If you only want some packages:
 1. Copy the `com.brennytizer.jumg.utils` package to your workspace.
 2. Copy your wanted packages across.
 3. The packages should be available for use!

#### If you want the full library (eclipse):
 PRE-REQ. Make sure the JUMG Library is a project in your workspace.
 1. Right Click your project > "Build Path" > "Configure Build Path..."
 2. "Projects" tab > "Add..."
 3. Tick the JUMG project you have made > OK > OK
 4. The packages should be available for use!

Note that these methods allow you to alter the packages, for your own personalization benefits, or to improve on JUMG. If you do make an improvement or addition that is not personalized, **request a push**!

### Extra Notes
JUMG is an open source tool that is freely available for modifications. Take it and throw it into eclipse, but remember that it would be nice that if you muddle around with it, that if you could throw a push request to the current JUMG build, here on GitHub.

JUMG uses the [Gnu GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt) license to support modification of the works presented in this repository - however one should always remember to not redistribute the works under their name. I mean, come on man, that's not cool. Changes and additions to the works will be credited with a name, the work committed, and a slogan (provided that I approve of the slogan).

On another note about the license, if you need to hit the road but have already downloaded this library, and want to read the license, you can check the LICENSE.md file in the root of the library folder.
